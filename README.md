# Obstacle-Detection-Using-Rador-and-Wirless-Data-Recorder-for-Flights
The design of simple Radar application using Arduino UNO is done. Radar is a long range object detection system that uses radio waves to establish certain parameters of an object like its range, speed and position. Radar technology is used in aircrafts, missiles, marine, weather predictions and automobiles.Further, it deals with logging the Planeâ€™s Parameter online, parameters like Engine Temperature, Fuel Level, Speed, Location (Latitude and Longitude) etc., for this we have used respective sensors interfaced to the Micro-Controller through Multiplexer and ADC and a On Board GPS to sense the exact location of the plane. The plane sends this information online via ZIGBEE to the Ground unit which keeps a track of hundreds of planes at one time.
